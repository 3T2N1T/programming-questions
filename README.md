### *If you haven't done Tasks 1-4, then don't look further through this branch*
It would be better if you tried these on your own before looking at this branch to check your work/your reasoning
   
### Your task
Complete the 4 tasks to the best of your ability
### Let's get started!
1. Click the Fork Button

2. Select your name (In this case I would select my github account name)

3. Now it should give you a repo that is the exact same as the original repo, but instead is your own to edit. 
4. Each task is split up into it's own branch, you can maneuver these different branches like so

5. We **will** be checking these at some point, so make sure to comment your code so we can see your thought process while you complete these (It's okay if you don't get a task finished, just move on. Comments are enough to let us see how we can help you with that area).
### Info
This branch contains solutions to Tasks 1-4 along with reasoning as to why they are done this way  
**By no means** are these only way to do these tasks, so don't just copy them (unless they are, in which case go right along).  
We would rather you use this as a guide rather than thinking of it as a "key" (even though it's called a key)
